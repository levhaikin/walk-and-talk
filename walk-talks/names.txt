kid: dad, I forgot the "tslilim" book at home! how would I be able to learn today?
me: oh.. hmm.. well, we can't go back home now, or you'll be late..
me: ooh, I know! I'll bring it afterwards. do you think they'll let me get in and give it to you?
kid: no dad. the gurad won't let you in.. [starts weeping a bit]
me: wait, I'll just ask the guard to deliver the book to you.
kid: ok dad.
me: ok, problem solved. so, what should I tell the guard?
kid: daaad, just tell him it's for me! [duh..]
me: but there are a lot of "you" in school, right? he might bring it to some other kid, right?
kid: [clap on forehead] so tell him it's for Itay!
me: i'll just tell him that he should look for a small kid, blond hair, very cute!
me: wait, what if he finds a different "Itay" who is blond and cute? the book will get lost!
kid: dad.. so tell him that i'm in "alef 3". there are no other "Itay" in my class.
me: oh, that's a good idea.
me: so, do you know how this is called? we call that an "address". it's like a label or a tag that the guard can use in order to locate you, and not someone else.
kid: but I don't live in school, dad!
me: right. but address can be used not only for a home. a school can also have an address. even a class can have an address. and even you can have address. when you are at home you have our home address, and when in school a different one.
me: that's a kind of a "name" actually.
me: wanna know our full address or your full name? it's: milkeyway galaxy, solar system, planet earth, [] country, [] city, [] street, [] number, Itay.
kid: ...
