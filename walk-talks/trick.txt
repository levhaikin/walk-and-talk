me: remember how when you were little, I told you to do a trick?
kid: eeh, you mean with the sleeve?
me: yeah. it was supposed to help you wear a sweatshirt or a coat on top of a long-sleeve shirt.
kid: yeah dad, we still do it! I need to hold the sleeve with my fingerts before I wear my coat!
me: exactly. I called it a "trick", and that became the name of this action. but you know that there are many others "tricks" that are not related to sleeves or coats.
kid: yeah, like magic tricks?
me: yep, physics tricks like the suction of a boiled egg through a bottleneck using a match, right?
kid: yeah, that's cool! also with the volcano using soda and vinegar!
me: right, right. these tricks are designed to entertain. they make you curious and they make you say: "wow, this is cool", right?
kid: they _are_ cool dad!
me: no doubt. the trick with the sleeve is deisgned to ease wearing a coat. without it - it's still doable, right? it's would just be less fun because you would have to somehow pull the underlying sleeve back.
kid: ..
me: so, yesterday when I told you "lets call the time it took both persons to meet with the letter 't'", remember? that was a trick. it is designed to help us to calculate the time it took them to meet after they left from different places and were headed towards each other.
kid: oh..
me: yeah. we invent tricks all the time. sometimes it's related to every-day activity, sometimes to math, sometimes to computers. builders use tricks. the world is full of tricks!
me: sometimes, some tricks are so useful that we give them a promotion and call them a "method". for example builders use concrete mixed with steel when they build high buildings. this is a very nice trick because it makes the wall much stronger, and also concrete and steel expand and retract similarly with temperature. if they weren't the wall would break.
kid: really?
me: yeah, imagine that the steel expands faster than concrete in higher temperature. it would "crack" the concrete.
