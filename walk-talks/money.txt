kid: dad, how much money do you have in the bank?
me: eeh, enough I hope?
kid: but how much? ben said his father has two and a half million in the bank!
me: oh, really? that's a lot. why does he need so much?
kid: to buy things! buy a big house!
me: I see. what if money didn't exist?
kid: how would we buy things?
me: exactly. how would we? if I need to buy some apples and cucumbers to prepare your lunch box for school, I would have to grow apples and cucumbers myself.
kid: we will start growing food?
me: that's an option, yes. or find food in the wild, like the prehistoric people did. they searched the forests for food. later on they started growing food by themselves. but what if I needed some medicine. a medicine is more complicated to produce. where would I get it?
kid: eeh, in the drug store!
me: ok, lets suppose stores still exist, and we don't actually need to grow or prepare stuff on our own. but what would we give the store in return for the drug that I need?
kid: eeh, I don't know.. oh, maybe we can give them my old bike!
me: I guess we can offer them your old bike. do you think the drug store would want them?
kid: eeh..
me: what if one of your friends wants your bike. he has some old clothes that he doesn't use anymore, and he is prepared to give them in exchange for the bike.
kid: no way! I don't need his old clothes.
me: right. now suppose another friend has a brand new pair of roller blades.
kid: wow! Maybe I can get them from him?
me: perhaps. he doesn't want your old bike though.
kid: what does he want? maybe we can give him something else we have?
me: we don't have anything else to give..
kid: it's hopeless?
me: maybe not. he says he wants some clothes.
kid: but we don't have any clothes! it doesn't help us!
me: yes, but your other friend has some clothes that we didn't want, and he also wanted your old bike remember?
kid: aahh! we can exchange our bike for his clothes, and then run to the other friend and exchange the clothes for the roller blades! yes!
me: yep. that would work.
