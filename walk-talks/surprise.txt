me: what if I told you that tomorrow you are going to school?
kid: so what?
me: and what if I told you that tomorrow morning you would go to the pool?
kid: really??
me: no, but why are you excited?
kid: I didn't expect to go to the pool instead of school tomorrow
me: why not?
kid: because, dad! I always go to school! not to the pool!
me: and what if I told you that I'm going to take you to school tomorrow, from zero to a hundred, what would be the number you would give that?
kid: eeh, 100!
me: and what if I told you that mom is going to take you to school tomorrow? what number will you give that?
kid: eeh, 98..
me: really? that means that out of a hundred times that you go to school, mom is taking you 98 of them..
kid: ok, so 1
me: yep, that's more like it :)
[some time passes]
me: listen, I told mom about our previous conversation. she wasn't really listening until I got to the part where I told her that I asked you what you thought about the chances that she would take you to school tomorrow. at that point she started smiling and really wanted to know your answer
kid: what? was she surprised?
me: exactly! she didn't expect that question, and so she was very interested in hearing your answer :)
