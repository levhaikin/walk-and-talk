* take an already grounded concept (e.g. names, address etc) and discuss/ask irregular questions about it. For example, how to explain someone where you live.
* use very very very concrete and grounded examples.
* always give at least two seemingly unrelated examples that would convey the concept.
* look at things using an irregular perspective. for example to illustrate the concept "name" we can:
  * ask what if we didn't have names. how would you ask your parent to buy cornflakes in the supermarket without using words that are names? beware, "yellow" is also a name!
  * can name be a picture? (yes - flags for example can be used as names of countries)
* examples should be surprising so that they will be imprinted in memory for a long time.
