kid: dad, how much money do you have in the bank?
me: eeh, enough I hope?
kid: but how much? ben said his father has two and a half million in the bank!
me: oh, really? that's a lot. why does he need so much?
kid: to buy things! buy a big house!
me: I see. what if money didn't exist?
kid: how would we buy things?
me: exactly. how would we? suppose you want to buy a pair of roller blades.
kid: eeh, I don't know.. oh, maybe we can give my old bike in exchange!
me: I guess we can offer your old bike.
me: what if one of your friends wants your bike. he has some old clothes that he doesn't use anymore, and he is prepared to give them in exchange for the bike.
kid: no way! I don't need his old clothes.
me: right. now suppose another friend has a brand new pair of roller blades.
kid: wow! Maybe I can get them from him?
me: perhaps. he doesn't want your old bike though.
kid: what does he want? maybe we can give him something else we have?
me: we don't have anything else to give..
kid: it's hopeless?
me: maybe not. he says he wants some clothes.
kid: but we don't have any clothes! it doesn't help us!
me: yes, but your other friend has some clothes that we didn't want, and he also wanted your old bike remember?
kid: aahh! we can exchange our bike for his clothes, and then run to the other friend and exchange the clothes for the roller blades! yes!
me: yep. that would work.
kid: it's like how we pokemon trade cards at school, dad!
me: yeah. but what if your friend who gave you the roller blades, didn't want clothes nor your old bike, but instead some a new school bag?
kid: nooo! now we need to find someone who has a bag and wants one of our items??
me: unfortunately, yes.
