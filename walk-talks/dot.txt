me: wanna talk about geometry?
kid: no no no!!
me: ok. how about dots then?
kid: dots?
me: yeah. like a dot that you can create with a pencil on a paper sheet. is it really a dot?
kid: yes dad, you just said that we can use a pencil to draw a dot [hand on forehead]
me: but what if you take a microscope and look at it. does it still look like a dot?
kid: uh.. no.. it looks like a circle.
kid: ooh, I know! I will create a very small dot. just barely touch the paper.
me: ok. I will give you a more powerful microscope then. would you still see a dot?
kid: oof. again a circle. dad, I'll just create a super very tiny dot then.
me: it won't help because I will give you an even more powerful microscope.
kid: dad, so we can't create a dot?
me: nope. in our world we can't. we can create 3d objects only.
kid: what are 3d objects dad? I don't understand..
me: well, everything around us including us actually. we are "more" than a dot, right?
kid: yes. I still don't understand.
me: let me then ask you can you draw a line on paper?
kid: yes!
me: what if I gave you a microscope? [smile]
kid: so what? we will see a line!
me: no we won't. you know what we will see? a rectangle.
kid: [thinking] yes, ok.
kid: so we can't create a line?
me: nope. can you draw one side of a die?
kid: no?
me: right [smile]. so what is a dot then? can you imagine it?
kid: yes, it's easy to imagine a dot!
me: so what is it?
kid: I don't know dad. I can only imagine it in my head. it's a small point.
me: ok. a point is a good word for it. maybe it's a place?
kid: eeh..
me: remember what the brain of a computer looks like?
kid: yes dad! it's small [shows using fingers] and it can do everything in the computer.
me: sort of, yeah. remember that it has these things called "transistors" in it? a lot of them. billions of them.
kid: yeah! there are billions and they are very very small, right dad?
me: yep. if there are billions of them in such a small volume, then they are very close together, right?
kid: yes?
me: ok. so, in the factory where they are produced, they must be able to somehow put every transistor in the correct place, otherwise it might end up in a place of another transistor and they both won't work.
kid: yes, how do they do that dad?
me: we can talk about "how" exactly some other time, ok? lets just say that we need to be able to tell the machine that puts the transistors, where to put them. we can tell it the place using a point. it's kind of a "place".
kid: but if we look in a microscope we will still see something that is not a dot, right?
me: correct. we can't create a dot, but we want to be able to make smaller and smaller transistors, and place them nearer and nearer to each other in the future.
me: for that, we invented dots or points. we can think of a dot as a place. it is "infinitely" small. you can think of it that no matter which microscope you will use, the dot would always look like a dot. not a circle. this is not possible in the real world of course.
kid: uuhh.. I dont' understand.
me: do you think a dot exists?
kid: no, because it's always a circle.
me: I think it does exist.
kid: how?
me: does "happy" exist?
kid: ehh.. 
me: is it something you can hold in your hand?
kid: no..
me: is it something that you can draw on paper?
kid: I can draw a smiling man
me: right. so mostly "happy" exists inside our head. in our brain. agree?
kid: yyyeah.. kind of..
me: I think that a dot exists too, but only in our head. in our brain. in our imagination. just like "happy".
kid: oooh. ok, I think I understand.
me: good! so, a dot or a point is something that doesn't exist in the real world. it exists in our brain. and it's useful because we use it to build the brain of a computer. and actually for many other things as well where we need to put things in certain exact places.
