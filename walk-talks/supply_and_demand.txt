me: wanna talk about what is a government?
kid: there is a prime minister and there is a minister of treasure
me: right. do you know what is the minister of treasure does?
kid: to look over the money and to divide it?
me: ..
kid: so why won't he just print more money?
me: well, that generally causes uprise in prices. so for example potatoes would cost more money.
kid: then the prime minister should say that it's forbiden to raise prices!
me: well, then people would stop grow potatoes, right? because they will get small amount of money due to the decree..
