me: what is the greatest number?
kid: google plex squared!
me: lets take google plex squared and add 1 to it
kid: then google plex squared squared!
me: I can still take google plex squared squared and add 1 to it
kid: eeh..
me: do you think that a "largest number" exists?
kid: no?
me: right, it doesn't exist. numbers are infinite. they don't "stop" on coming.
kid: aah. dad, I have a riddle: how can one be two and two be infinite?
me: eeh..
kid: one mirror is two "you" and two mirrors are infinite "you"!
me: oh.. that's a cool riddle. good job!
