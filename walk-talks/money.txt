kid: dad, how much money do you have in the bank?
me: eeh, enough I hope?
kid: but how much? ben said his father has two and a half million in the bank!
me: oh, really? that's a lot. why does he need so much?
kid: to buy things! buy a big house!
me: I see. what if money didn't exist?
kid: how would we buy things?
me: exactly. how would we? if I need to buy some apples and cucumbers to prepare your lunch box for school, I would have to grow apples and cucumbers myself.
kid: we will start growing food?
me: yep. or find food in the wild, like the prehistoric people did. they searched the forests for food. later on they started growing food by themselves. but what if I needed some medicine. where would I get it?
kid: eeh, in the drug store!
me: ok, lets suppose stores still exist, and we don't actually need to grow or prepare stuff on our own. but what would I give the store in return for the drug that I need?
kid: eeh, I don't know.. oh, maybe we can give them my old bike!
me: that's an interesting thought. but what if they don't need it?
kid: yeah, then give them mom's earings.
me: mom doesn't wear earings. but lets suppose we can give them things. eventually we would run out of things that we can give and they want, right?
kid: ah.
