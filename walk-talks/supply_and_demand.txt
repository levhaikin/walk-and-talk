me: wanna talk about what is a government?
kid: there is a prime minister and there is a minister of treasure
me: right. do you know what is the minister of treasure does?
kid: to look over the money and to divide it?
me: ..
kid: so why won't he just print more money?
me: well, that generally causes uprise in prices. so for example potatoes would cost more money.
kid: then the prime minister should say that it's forbiden to raise prices!
me: well, then people would stop grow potatoes, right? because they will get small amount of money because it's limited. it has a cap.
me: so, is government intervention good?
kid: no dad.
me: well I wouldn't say "no". but I would say that it's more complicated than it might look at first.
kid: but dad, the prices would just go up then? how can we stop them?
me: we can't. prices always go up. it's called "inflation". nevermind the word, it's just a name
kid: oh, a name like our address? like cornflakes right?
me: yep.
me: so, potatoes, bread and other things will cost more in the future.
kid: ... so .. dad. does your price go up as well?
me: [slightly surprised] yeah, why not?. how did you think of that?
kid: ...
me: I can come to my managers and tell them that I got a higher salary offer from a different work place, and I might leave if they don't raise my salary.
kid: so what? they have enough workers.
me: but what if half of the people left?
kid: not good..
me: exactly. when there is not enough people, their price goes up. i'm like a potato [smile]
kid: so why don't farmers plant less potatoes?
me: [shock]
