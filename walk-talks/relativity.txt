me: we forgot to take your basketball..
kid: oh :( that's not good. lets get back home and take it
me: we can't, you will be late to school
kid: I don't want to be late to school..
me: well, just ask the coach to give you a loaner
kid: ok
me: I hope your team wins the game today
kid: that would be great!
me: would it?
kid: of course it would, dad!
me: what if your best friend is going to end up in the other team? do you think he will agree?
kid: uh, no, he would be sad
me: that's right, I bet he would. so why did you say it would be great?
kid: because it's great! for me!
me: yes, great for you, bummer for your friend. so what does it mean that something is "great"? is it even true?
kid: what do you mean dad?
me: if you say something is great, and your friend says that it's not great, then who is right?
kid: I am! but also my friend is right..
me: yep. that means that from your perpective something can be great, and from another perspective it could be the opposite. it means that "great" is not absolute, but it's relative to someone.
kid: I'm sure we will win today, it would be great!
